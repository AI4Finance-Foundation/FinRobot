**FinRobot** is an AI Agent Platform that transcends the scope of FinGPT, representing a comprehensive solution meticulously designed for financial applications. It integrates **a diverse array of AI technologies**, extending beyond mere language models. This expansive vision highlights the platform's versatility and adaptability, addressing the multifaceted needs of the financial industry.

**Concept of AI Agent**: an AI Agent is an intelligent entity that uses large language models as its brain to perceive its environment, make decisions, and execute actions. Unlike traditional artificial intelligence, AI Agents possess the ability to independently think and utilize tools to progressively achieve given objectives.

## FinRobot Ecosystem
<div align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot/assets/31713746/6b30d9c1-35e5-4d36-a138-7e2769718f62" width="90%"/>
</div>

### The overall framework of FinRobot is organized into four distinct layers, each designed to address specific aspects of financial AI processing and application:
1. **Financial AI Agents Layer**: The Financial AI Agents Layer now includes Financial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, enhancing complex analysis and decision-making capacity. Market Forecasting Agents, Document Analysis Agents, and Trading Strategies Agents utilize CoT to dissect financial challenges into logical steps, aligning their advanced algorithms and domain expertise with the evolving dynamics of financial markets for precise, actionable insights.
2. **Financial LLMs Algorithms Layer**: The Financial LLMs Algorithms Layer configures and utilizes specially tuned models tailored to specific domains and global market analysis. 
3. **LLMOps and DataOps Layers**: The LLMOps layer implements a multi-source integration strategy that selects the most suitable LLMs for specific financial tasks, utilizing a range of state-of-the-art models. 
4. **Multi-source LLM Foundation Models Layer**: This foundational layer supports the plug-and-play functionality of various general and specialized LLMs. 


## FinRobot: Agent Workflow
<div align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot/assets/31713746/ff8033be-2326-424a-ac11-17e2c9c4983d" width="60%"/>
</div>

1. **Perception**: This module captures and interprets multimodal financial data from market feeds, news, and economic indicators, using sophisticated techniques to structure the data for thorough analysis.

2. **Brain**: Acting as the core processing unit, this module perceives data from the Perception module with LLMs and utilizes Financial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes to generate structured instructions.

3. **Action**: This module executes instructions from the Brain module, applying tools to translate analytical insights into actionable outcomes. Actions include trading, portfolio adjustments, generating reports, or sending alerts, thereby actively influencing the financial environment.

## FinRobot: Smart Scheduler
<div align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot/assets/31713746/06fa0b78-ac53-48d3-8a6e-98d15386327e" width="60%"/>
</div>

The Smart Scheduler is central to ensuring model diversity and optimizing the integration and selection of the most appropriate LLM for each task.
* **Director Agent**: This component orchestrates the task assignment process, ensuring that tasks are allocated to agents based on their performance metrics and suitability for specific tasks.
* **Agent Registration**: Manages the registration and tracks the availability of agents within the system, facilitating an efficient task allocation process.
* **Agent Adaptor**: Tailor agent functionalities to specific tasks, enhancing their performance and integration within the overall system.
* **Task Manager**: Manages and stores different general and fine-tuned LLMs-based agents tailored for various financial tasks, updated periodically to ensure relevance and efficacy.
