# Clean Data

Clean messy data in the active sheet or a specified range.

## Environment

- **If running inside Excel (Office Add-in / Office JS):** Use Office JS directly (`Excel.run(async (context) => {...})`). Read via `range.values`, write helper-column formulas via `range.formulas = [["=TRIM(A2)"]]`. The in-place vs helper-column decision still applies.
- **If operating on a standalone .xlsx file:** Use Python/openpyxl.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scope

- If a range is given (e.g. `A1:F200`), use it
- Otherwise use the full used range of the active sheet
- Profile each column: detect its dominant type (text / number / date) and identify outliers

### Step 2: Detect issues

| Issue | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Whitespace | leading/trailing spaces, double spaces |
| Casing | inconsistent casing in categorical columns (`usa` / `USA` / `Usa`) |
| Number-as-text | numeric values stored as text; stray `$`, `,`, `%` in number cells |
| Dates | mixed formats in the same column (`3/8/26`, `2026-03-08`, `March 8 2026`) |
| Duplicates | exact-duplicate rows and near-duplicates (case/whitespace differences) |
| Blanks | empty cells in otherwise-populated columns |
| Mixed types | a column that's 98% numbers but has 3 text entries |
| Encoding | mojibake (`Ã©`, `â€™`), non-printing characters |
| Errors | `#REF!`, `#N/A`, `#VALUE!`, `#DIV/0!` |

### Step 3: Propose fixes

Show a summary table before changing anything:

| Column | Issue | Count | Proposed Fix |
|---|---|---|---|

### Step 4: Apply

- **Prefer formulas over hardcoded cleaned values** — where the cleaned output can be expressed as a formula (e.g. `=TRIM(A2)`, `=VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(B2,"$",""))`, `=UPPER(C2)`, `=DATEVALUE(D2)`), write the formula in an adjacent helper column rather than computing the result in Python and overwriting the original. This keeps the transformation transparent and auditable.
- Only overwrite in place with computed values when the user explicitly asks for it, or when no sensible formula equivalent exists (e.g. encoding/mojibake repair)
- For destructive operations (removing duplicates, filling blanks, overwriting originals), confirm with the user first
- After each category of fix (whitespace → casing → number conversion → dates → dedup), show the user a sample of what changed and get confirmation before moving to the next category
- Report a before/after summary of what changed
